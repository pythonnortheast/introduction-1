"""
This is a *very* brief introduction to Strings and slices in Python.
"""
>>>
    A string literal is a *sequence* of bytes.
>>>
    This string has been assigned to a variable called "message"
>>>
>>>
    We can check that an item is *in* the string
>>>
>>>
    And check that an item is *not* *in* the string
>>>
    You can *iterate* through the items in a string
>>>
    Here's another string
>>>
    We can concatenate strings using the plus/ addition "+" operator
>>>
>>>
    A string can be copied using the asterix "*" operator
>>>
    A string has a length
>>>
    Items in a string can be copied from a string using a zero-based index
>>>
    Negative index values return items from the end of the string
>>>
    Items in a string can be copied using *slices*. Slices are index points in a
    string separated by a colon ":".
>>>
    The "from" and "to" index values can be positive or negative.
>>>
    By not providing a "to" index value, Python will continue until the end of
the string. **Python continues *stepping* along the slice until either
end of the string is reached, but we'll come back to that.**
>>>
>>>
>>>
    You can specify the number of *steps* to take through a slice using a 2nd
    colon ":".
>>>
>>>
>>>
    The *value* of a slice's step can not be zero.
>>>
    However, steps in a slice can be negative.
>>>
"""
This last section can be skipped if time is short
"""
    Strings have methods. Most methods return a copy of the string. These are
just a few.
>>>
>>>
>>>
    Some methods return a boolean. These are just a couple.
>>>
>>>
    Some methods return other types of sequences. These methods return lists
(which is the topic of our next talk).
